Nowadays, we have to face up to the facts that the development of human 

society has, on a large scale, effected the nature. The environment being 

polluted, resources being used up, wild animals reducing, we have to admit the 

nature we are relying on, in return, has made our lives harder as higher prices, 

worse weather, as well as, bigger disasters.  

So protecting nature is not only for the earth, but also for ourselves. But 

what can we do for it? Well, if everyone raises the awareness of protecting 

nature, actually, it's not that difficult. First of all, it's easy but very effective to 

learn to put the rubbish in proper ways. It can be helpful to release the pressure 

of recycling the rubbish. Second, it is suggested that take more buses instead of 

private cars, in which can reduce the gas pollution and save the oil. What's more, 

why not plant trees frequently so that we can protect the planet.  

Of course, it's more practical if we can get benefits from the environment 

protection, so that it will keep longer. The best way to be like this, I think, is not 

greedy. So we can cut trees in a proper approach instead of cutting all of them 

in a time. Growing foods rather than build houses in the fields to make more 

money.  

So I think the time when the nature became beautiful again will not be long 

as long as we work together to protect our nature as well as ourselves
